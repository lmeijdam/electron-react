## Electron and React

Clone this repo to get started with Electron and React. You will find 2 folders inside, 'electron-react-start' will contain the most basic set up for Electron / Webpack / React and Babel for transpiling.

The other folder will contain the same but with the Material Design of Google. It is optimized for React inside a new library and can be found [here](https://github.com/tleunen/react-mdl)

### Getting started

After cloning both folders you can manually delete the one you don't want to use. After deleting, navigate to the folder and run;
````
 npm install 
````
to install all depending packages.

> Please note to install Webpack globally. A helpfull article about Webpack can be found on my blog:
> [Webpack Tutorial](http://www.larsmeijdam.nl/2016/07/To-pack-or-not-to-pack/)

After installing all the dependencies and Webpack globally. You can run;
````
    webpack
````
For all the files to be bundled and minified. 

Last but not least. You can run;
````
 npm start 
````
So a Electron app will appear on screen. It is a basic window of 800x600 showing one single React Component.

Have fun creating your own apps!
